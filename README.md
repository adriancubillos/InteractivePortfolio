## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Built with React.js for the user interface, Three.js for 2D/3D manipulation, and styled with Tailwind CSS, this amazing Portfolio Website features a responsive layout and a sleek, modern design.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** is a JavaScript library used to create and display 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It simplifies the process of using WebGL, allowing developers to easily create and display 3D scenes, animations, and interactive experiences on the web

- **[React.js](https://react.dev/reference/react)** is a JavaScript library developed by Meta for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, leading to more efficient and predictable code. React is widely used for developing single-page applications (SPAs) due to its virtual DOM that improves performance and ease of maintenance.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS, enabling rapid and responsive UI development.
